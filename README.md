## ⚡ What is Big(O)wl?
> [!NOTE]  
> **Big(O)wl** is a Gen-Z-coded Chrome Extension that lets you select/highlight any code on a webpage and instantly tells you the **Time Complexity** and **Space Complexity** along with the Plot for Visualization — powered by AI.  
Whether you're reviewing someone's GitHub, reading articles, or prepping for interviews in damn LEET CODE, this extension has your back.



## 🤔 Why Big(O)wl ?
> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Got this idea from Leetcode's Analyze Complexity feature which gives you the complexity analysis of your code along with the Plot, But **for the non-premium users this feature is available only for once at a day**. So In the other hand **Big(O)wl** provides it for free as much as you want with more analytical features.  



## 🧠 Features

- 🔍 **Highlight-to-Analyze**  
  Just select code like you’re copying it — and boom, it appears in the extension popup.

- 🚀 **One-Click Complexity Detection**  
  Uses the Groq LLM API to give instant insights into Big-O time & space complexity.

- 📈 **Visual Complexity Graphs**  
  Dynamic plots of common complexity curves with your selected one highlighted in style.

- 📦 **Minimal, Clean, Fast**  
  Built with React 18, Vite, and SCSS for a blazing fast UX.

- 🧠 **Smart Filtering**  
  Ignores non-code or unrelated code (like API/server/infra), keeping the output relevant to DSA problems only.
